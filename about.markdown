Hey, I’m **Amir Hossein Sarebani**—a Computer Engineering student and system programmer at [Zitel ISP](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ztel). I’m into low-level stuff, high-performance systems, C/C++, computer networks, cybersecurity, and other areas that dive deep into how systems really work.

This is just my personal journal—a place to jot down what I’m reading or learning day to day. Most of it’s tech-related, but it could be from anywhere in computer science. Writing things out helps me understand them better.

Just a heads-up: **none of this is meant to be a reference**. It’s more like a collection of notes and thoughts. If something here helps you, awesome—but double-check it.

Thanks for dropping by.
